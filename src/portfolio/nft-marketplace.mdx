## Project: Ghostmarket

### Problem:

Ghostmarket needed to expand beyond Phantasma to other chains (ETH, BSC, Polygon, Avalanche) to be a major player amoung the NFT marketplaces, while maintaining contract security and development efficiency.

### Solution:

- Migrated Opensource codebase from Truffle to Hardhat for modern testing/deployment
- Across multiple mainets deployed: 
 - ERC721/ERC1155 contracts 
 - Custom Marketplace contracts 
 - Relayer contracts for nft market makers
- Built a SDK kit to interact with the smart contracts of the marketplace

### Impact:

<ul className="impact-list">
  - Very fast contract iterations thanks to modern development frameworks
  - Multichain support across major chains
  - First Multichain marketplaces on Avalanche
</ul>
