## Technical Leadership for Global Engineering

### Strategic Challenges:
1. **Delivery Velocity**:
   - Maintaining consistent throughput across timezones
   - Optimizing CI/CD pipelines for distributed teams
   - Balancing autonomy with architectural alignment

2. **Technical Excellence**:
   - Enforcing code quality standards globally
   - Scaling engineering practices (TDD, pair programming)
   - Managing technical debt in distributed codebases

3. **Organizational Design**:
   - Structuring teams for optimal flow (Conway's Law)
   - Building effective platform teams
   - Creating scalable knowledge sharing systems

### Using data based framework for tracking progress:

#### Technical Practices:
- **Trunk-based development** with feature flags
- **Test automation** pyramid implementation
- **Deployment automation** with progressive delivery
- **Observability-driven development** practices

#### Process Architecture:
- **Value stream mapping** for distributed workflows
- **Team topologies** optimization
- **Remote-first ceremonies** design
- **Metrics that matter** (DORA + SPACE)

#### Leadership Approach:
- **Psychological safety** at scale
- **Engineering enablement** strategies
- **Technical career ladders** for distributed teams
- **Architecture decision records** process

### Results Framework:
<ul className="impact-list">
- High improvement in lead time
