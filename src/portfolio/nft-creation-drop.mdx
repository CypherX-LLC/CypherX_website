## Project: Familia

### Problem:

Familia's team of NFT enthusiasts needed to execute a groundbreaking Solana NFT drop that would:

1) Handle high mint volume without network congestion
2) Ensure fairness in rarity distribution
3) Deploy and mint cost-effectively on Solana

### Solution:

We engineered an end-to-end solution using:

- PFP generation with hashlips art engine 

- Metaplex Core for standardized NFT creation

- Custom Candy Machine V2 implementation for:

- Phased allowlist/public sale mechanics

- Anti-bot protection via token-gated minting

- Arweave storage for cost-efficient metadata

- Real-time royalty tracking across secondary markets

- React frontend with Phantom wallet integration


### Impact:
<ul className="impact-list">
- NFTs sold with zero failed transactions
- very low mint costs achieved vs. Ethereum alternatives
</ul>

## Project: Svenir

### Problem:

Svenir's crypto-native team of NFT enthusiasts wanted to create an inclusive NFT drop where users could purchase with both crypto and credit cards, addressing three key challenges:

1) **Fiat onboarding** - Allow non-crypto users to participate without wallet setup  
2) **Instant delivery** - Avoid delays from traditional payment processors  
3) **Compliance** - Maintain KYC/AML while preserving decentralization  

### Solution:

Built a hybrid purchase flow using:  
- **Crossmint integration** for credit card payments  
- **Dynamic NFT minting** that:  
  - Holds assets in escrow for credit card purchases  
  - Releases to buyer's wallet  
- **Gasless onboarding** via:  
  - Temporary custodial wallets for fiat users  
  - One-click migration to self-custody  

### Impact:
<ul className="impact-list">
- **half of sales** came from credit card users (new audience)  
- ** very fast delivery** for all payment methods  
- **100% compliance** 
</ul>
