## Project: HyperNestDAO

### Problem:
HyperNEST needed a sophisticated token management system that would:
1. Prevent token dumping through restrictive transfer rules
2. Incentivize long-term participation with time-locked staking
3. Enable flexible DAO governance while maintaining economic security
4. Handle complex reward distribution scenarios

### Solution:
Built custom Solidity contracts implementing:
- **Controlled wNEST Transfers**:
  - Whitelisted contract-to-wallet flows only
  - Complete restriction of P2P transfers
- **Time-Based Staking**:
  - 1-24 month flexible locking periods
  - Automatic mint/burn mechanism for wNEST conversion
- **Anti-Gaming Mechanics**:
  - Full-balance requirement for reward claims
  - Partial unstake penalty system
  - Slashing integration for governance violations
- **Multi-Sig Admin Controls**:
  - DAO-operated parameter adjustments
  - Emergency pause functionality

### Impact:

### Key Innovations:
- "Burn-to-claim" reward mechanism prevents gaming
- Progressive unstaking penalties align with DAO goals
- Gas-optimized for frequent DAO operations
