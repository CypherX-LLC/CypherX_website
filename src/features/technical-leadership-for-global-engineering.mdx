### Strategic Challenges:
1. **Delivery Velocity**:
   - Maintaining consistent throughput across timezones
   - Optimizing CI/CD pipelines for distributed teams
   - Balancing autonomy with architectural alignment

2. **Technical Excellence**:
   - Enforcing code quality standards globally
   - Scaling engineering practices (TDD, pair programming)
   - Managing technical debt in distributed codebases

3. **Organizational Design**:
   - Structuring teams for optimal flow (Conway's Law)
   - Building effective platform teams
   - Creating scalable knowledge sharing systems

### Using data based framework for tracking progress:
